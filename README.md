# Description
   * This is a sample docker compose model to make an communication or link between apache -> tomcat -> mysql.
   * I've added sample web application war files in tomcat/ directory, which are placed inside tomcat/webapps directory in tomcat container.
   * Docker compose - used to run multi container docker application.
